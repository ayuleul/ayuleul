Hello, I'm Leul Ayalew! 👋🏽

I'm a Frontend (Web and Mobile) developer based in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia. I frequently use Typescript, Javascript, React, and React Native. For mobile apps, I also enjoy flutter and java. I am dedicated to continuously developing, implementing and adopting new technologies to maximize development efficiency and develop innovative applications.

You may find me walking and meeting new people in my spare time!
