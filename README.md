Hello, I'm Leul Ayalew! 👋🏽

I'm a Frontend (Web and Mobile) developer based in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia. For developing mobile and web apps, I frequently use Typescript, Javascript, React, and React Native. For mobile apps, I also enjoy flutter and java. I'm constantly trying to learn as much as I can.

You may find me walking and meeting new people in my spare time!
