Hello, I'm Leul Ayalew! 👋🏽

I'm a Frontend (Web and Mobile) developer living in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, with a desire to create things that improve people's daily lives. At the moment, I'm interested in Typescript, Javascript, React, React Native, and developing both mobile and web apps as well as developer tools.

In my spare time, you may find me biking, walking, traveling, and meeting new people!
